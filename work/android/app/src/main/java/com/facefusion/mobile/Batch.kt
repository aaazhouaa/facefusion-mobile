/**
 * One queued target — roadmap 14.
 *
 * The batch is ONE SOURCE, MANY TARGETS. That is the shape a user asks for ("put my face on
 * these twelve clips") and it is the shape the warm pipeline already has: `setSource` is
 * called once and every target reuses it, so the models and the identity are paid for once
 * instead of twelve times. The two alternatives were considered and rejected — many sources
 * against one target is a comparison sheet nobody asked for, and the cartesian product of
 * both is a way to fill a phone by accident.
 *
 * Immutable, and replaced rather than mutated, because Compose observes the LIST: mutating
 * an item in place leaves the list reference equal and the row never redraws.
