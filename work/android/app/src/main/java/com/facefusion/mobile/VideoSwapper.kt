 * Decode -> swap -> encode, with the original audio copied through and an optional trim.

 * Deliberately ByteBuffer-based rather than Surface/GL: a Surface pipeline never exposes the
 * pixels to the CPU, and every frame has to reach the NPU as packed BGR anyway.  The
 * decoder's YUV_420_888 output carries arbitrary row/pixel strides (semi-planar chroma shows
 * up as pixelStride 2), so both strides are honoured in yuvToBgr -- assuming tightly packed
 * I420 gives a green-and-magenta image.
 *
 * Trimming seeks to the sync frame at or before trimStartUs and decodes forward, discarding
 * output frames before the mark: seeking straight to an arbitrary timestamp would land on a
 * non-keyframe and decode garbage until the next IDR.  Output timestamps are rebased to zero
 * so the result starts where the trim does.
