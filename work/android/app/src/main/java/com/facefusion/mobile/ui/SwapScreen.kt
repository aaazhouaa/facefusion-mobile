 * Shared with [LiveScreen] rather than private to this file: Live is a tab, so it can be
 * the first screen a fresh install sees, and it needs the same offer. It briefly had a
 * plain Button of its own instead -- same onDownload, but none of the progress, the byte
 * counter, the error or the retry, so the two screens disagreed about what a download
