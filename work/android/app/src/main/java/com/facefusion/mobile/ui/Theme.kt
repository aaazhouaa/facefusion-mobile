/**
 * The app's colour and type.
 *
 * The accent is **neutral monochrome** — no brand hue at all. The requested palette is a
 * light `#F7F8FA` page and a dark `#121212` page with `#FFFFFF` / `#1E1E1E` cards, so the
 * accent resolves to the text colour itself: near-black `#1D1D1D` on the light scheme,
 * near-white `#E4E4E7` on the dark one. A control that is ON is therefore a solid dark
 * (light scheme) or solid light (dark scheme) chip with a contrasting label, and it holds
 * a high-contrast relationship with both schemes without introducing a second hue.
 *
 * The user can pin light or dark in Settings, and the choice survives a restart
 * ([ThemePrefs]); until one is made the phone chooses ([isSystemInDarkTheme]). Two things
 * that follow from that and are easy to miss:
 *
 *   * Nothing outside this file names a colour. Every screen reads MaterialTheme, so the
 *     light scheme needed no changes anywhere else -- verified by grep, not by hope.
 *   * The WINDOW is separate. `res/values/themes.xml` paints the frame before the first
 *     composition, so it needs its own light/night pair, and the system-bar icons have to
 *     flip with it or they vanish into their own background.
 *
 * The two schemes follow the requested palette exactly: dark is `#121212` page on
 * `#1E1E1E` cards with `#E4E4E7` text; light is `#F7F8FA` page on `#FFFFFF` cards with
 * `#1D1D1D` text. Cards and recessed panels share the card colour (controls sit on the
 * card colour too), so the hierarchy is carried by borders and by the contrast of the
 * monochrome accent rather than by a second grey step.
